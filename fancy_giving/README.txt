FancyGiving Coding Challenge
============================

Objective:      Make a class that takes the data in 'data.json' as
                input, and has a search method that returns all
                gift idea records whose title or description
                matches a search term given by the user.

Requirements:   Your code must pass the tests in test.rb.  You must
                not use external gems or libraries, only the core
                Ruby language and standard library.

Assessment:     We will take into consideration:

                  - Use of test driven development
                  - Good object oriented design
                  - Sophistication of search algorithm used
                  - Code readability

                A sophisticated, well written and easy to understand
                solution is best, but a simple algorithm that is easy
                to understand is better than a complex one that is
                implemented poorly.
