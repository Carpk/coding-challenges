## Ruby Challenges

These are some Ruby coding challenges that I found from around the web. Some may have been started as a secret gist and transfered here so thier history might get lost. All commands are to be ran from inside the folders directory.

### Battleship

Fun project that has yet to be completed, play battleship against a computer. As of now, you just take shots at the computer's pre-fixed board. Commands such as 'b3'.

`ruby battleship.rb`

### Euler

Excercises from Project Euler, only completed about 5 puzzles. None of which are very impressive.

### Ruby ToDo

This project was interesting, data get loaded from csv file and manipulated from the CL. I took it a bit further, wanting to symolize the passed arguments I found the `send` command.

`ruby todo.rb`(followed by the command you would like to use)

### SQL excercises

This is a small subset of some of the smaller SQL excercises we had to finish, other ones were too large to add to this format of 'sample excersices'. But can be found elsewhere in the repository.

### Sudoku

Command line solver that imports filed from 'unsolved' file and creates solutions for them. Orginally done in a group project, I couldnt sway the group to create a solution the way I envisioned, so this was my own solution. I feel its not too far away from a recursive formula.

`ruby sudoku.rb`
