## Ruby Challenges

These are some Ruby coding challenges that I found from around the web. Some may have been started as a secret gist and transfered here so thier history might get lost. All commands are to be ran from inside the folders directory.

### Battleship

Fun project that has yet to be completed, play battleship against a computer. As of now, you just take shots at the computer's pre-fixed board. Commands such as 'b3'.

`ruby battleship.rb`

### Ruby ToDo

This project was interesting, data get loaded from csv file and manipulated from the CL. I took it a bit further, wanting to symolize the passed arguments I found the `send` command.

`ruby todo.rb`(followed by the command you would like to use)

### Sudoku

Command line solver that imports filed from 'unsolved' file and creates solutions for them. Orginally done in a group project, I couldnt sway the group to create a solution the way I envisioned, so this was my own solution. I feel its not too far away from a recursive formula.

`ruby sudoku.rb`
