## Ruby Challenges

These are some Ruby coding challenges that I found from around the web. Some may have been started as a secret gist and transfered here so thier history might get lost.

#### Sudoku

Command line solver that imports filed from 'unsolved' file and creates solutions for them. Orginally done in a group project, I couldnt sway the group to create a solution the way I envisioned, so this was my own solution. I feel its not too far away from a recursive formula.

`ruby sudoku.rb`
