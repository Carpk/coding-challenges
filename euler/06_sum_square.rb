# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural 
# numbers is, 1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

# The square of the sum of the first ten natural 
# numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025

# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares 
# of the first ten natural numbers and the square of 
# the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares 
# of the first one hundred natural numbers and the 
# square of the sum.
